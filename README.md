# classification_for_imbalanced_data

Imbalanced Classification:Imbalanced classification is a supervised learning problem where one class outnumbers other class by a large proportion. This problem is faced more frequently in binary classification problems than multi-level classification problems.

ML algorithms tend to tremble when faced with imbalanced classification data sets. Moreover, they result in biased predictions and misleading accuracies.With imbalanced data sets, an algorithm doesnâ€™t get the necessary information about the minority class to make an accurate prediction.
